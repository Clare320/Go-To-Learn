## About Project

When we learn a new language, some troubles may be confusing:

- It seems easy, but when I start with new project, even a simple if-statements is hard!
- Too much words in the tutorial, but less proctice!

So the project aims to learn language base with a typical coding template.

Lets learn by practice!
